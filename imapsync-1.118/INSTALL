GETTING

PREREQUISITES
-------------

You need : 
- Perl 
  try : perl -v

  Get Perl here:
  http://www.perl.org/

- Perl Mail::IMAPClient module 
  try : perl -mMail::IMAPClient -e ''
  
  Get the Mail::IMAPClient module here:
  http://search.cpan.org/
  http://search.cpan.org/~djkernen/
  http://search.cpan.org/~djkernen/Mail-IMAPClient-2.2.9/
  
  In fact I use Mail-IMAPClient-2.1.4 (debian package)
  To know the version you have on your system try :
  perl -mMail::IMAPClient -e 'print $Mail::IMAPClient::VERSION, "\n"'

- Perl Digest::MD5 module. 
  http://search.cpan.org/
  http://search.cpan.org/~gaas/Digest-MD5-2.33/
  To know the version you have on your system try :
  perl -mDigest::MD5 -e 'print $Digest::MD5::VERSION, "\n"'
  I use 2.20 (debian package)

- (Option) Perl Digest::HMAC_MD5 module
  Good for non plain text password over network.


INSTALLING
----------
To see what will be done, just run:

make -n install

To install imapsync, just run:

make install

or copy the file imapsync where you want it to be.

TESTING
-------

The test will break as they are home specific.
You need a running imap server on localhost with two accounts
toto@est.belle with a password located in the file /var/tmp/secret1
titi@est.belle with a password located in the file /var/tmp/secret2

Of course, you can change the file tests.sh and run the tests with :

sh tests.sh

The tests.sh script break on first failure ("set -e" directive).

Since I added more tests you also need a remote imap server see the
file tests.sh and help yourself. No time to make a universal test
file.
