Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are
under /home/user/mail but the tool copies everything in
/home/user, how can i avoid that?

R. Use
   imapsync ... --include '^mail'
or (better)
   imapsync ... --subscribed --subscribe


   
Q. I'm migrating from WU to Cyrus, and the mail folders are
under /home/user/mail directory.  When imapsync creates the
folders in the new cyrus imap server, it makes a folder
"mail" and below that folder puts all the mail folders the
user have in /home/user/mail, i would like to have all those
folders directly under INBOX.

R. Use 
   imapsync ... --regextrans2 's/^mail/INBOX/' --dry
   look at the simulation and if all transformations seem
   good then remove the --dry option.
